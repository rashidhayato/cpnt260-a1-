      <p>Legs burning, sweat dripping down your brow, another soccer practice is in the books. Practicing drills with a team is crucial to success on the soccer field, but really that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With practice taking place a few times a week at two or three hour intervals, it becomes necessary to put in that off-field work to truly climb the ranks. The greatest soccer players know this, and often spend more time training individually than at official team practices.After a long workout with his youth club did little Leo Messi go home and eat cheetos, fingers tapping away at the Xbox controller? Definitely not. He put in more work, he trained harder. Why shouldn’t the same apply to all players? Well, it does. Of course, it’s ok to admit to confusion. Not everyone has the drive and inherent talent that Messi has, and it’s hard to know where to begin. At home training is difficult because there is no coach guiding you through the process, nor teammates to motivate you with a shared hunger for success. So rather than getting bogged down in that confusion, start with these seven tips guaranteed to help you improve your soccer skills.</p>

      <p>Education is an important step that you have to take in order to become successful in life. Education is the most powerful weapon for changing a difficult situation, because the slaves had a different skin color, the white people thought they were subhuman. In the book Nightjohn by Gary Paulsen, slave masters possessed power, wealth and freedom but their slaves had none.There was no schools for the slaves except there was schools for the white people. At the end of the novel, Nightjohn created a secret school, outside of the plantation, where slaves could learn to read and write. If any slave masters found someone who knew how to read write and if they were outside the plantation, they would be punished. For example: the slave masters would cut the slaves fingers or toes off or they would whip them on the back. </p>
