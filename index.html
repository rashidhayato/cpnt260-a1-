      <p>Education is an important step that you have to take in order to become successful in life. Education is the most powerful weapon for changing a difficult situation, because the slaves had a different skin color, the white people thought they were subhuman. In the book Nightjohn by Gary Paulsen, slave masters possessed power, wealth and freedom but their slaves had none.There was no schools for the slaves except there was schools for the white people. At the end of the novel, Nightjohn created a secret school, outside of the plantation, where slaves could learn to read and write. If any slave masters found someone who knew how to read write and if they were outside the plantation, they would be punished. For example: the slave masters would cut the slaves fingers or toes off or they would whip them on the back.The slaves of the 1700’s had no freedom at all. For example the slaves had no mobility rights. They weren’t allowed to go to different cities, countries or leave the plantation, without the slave masters permission. They didn’t have freedom of speech, they weren’t allowed to say anything against their master, and they were not permitted to believe in a religion.
