      <p>Legs burning, sweat dripping down your brow, another soccer practice is in the books. Practicing drills with a team is crucial to success on the soccer field, but really that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With practice taking place a few times a week at two or three hour intervals, it becomes necessary to put in that off-field work to truly climb the ranks. The greatest soccer players know this, and often spend more time training individually than at official team practices.After a long workout with his youth club did little Leo Messi go home and eat cheetos, fingers tapping away at the Xbox controller? Definitely not. He put in more work, he trained harder. <p><strong>One example of bold text;</strong>Why shouldn’t the same apply to all players? Well, it does. Of course, it’s ok to admit to confusion. Not everyone has the drive and inherent talent that Messi has, and it’s hard to know where to begin. At home training is difficult because there is no coach guiding you through the process, nor teammates to motivate you with a shared hunger for success. So rather than getting bogged down in that confusion, start with these seven tips guaranteed to help you improve your soccer skills. No one likes this part about soccer, but cardiovascular fitness is crucial to being able to outpace opponents. Start off with a mile or two twice a week, and try to get progressively faster. The more you do it, the more the seconds will shave off. Your body will feel better and more comfortable and that will translate onto the field. Set up a five to eight cones or bottles paced out over ten yards and dribble through them, serpentining through the cones. Work hard on leading with your dominant foot, but focus even more on your non-dominant foot. It may seem basic, but being able to move the ball in tight spaces with each foot is fundamental to your success. Remember to keep your head up as best as you can.</p>

  <h2>Here are some helpful tips you can use </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Before you even begin to work on your technical skills, you better get running.</li>
    <li>Work on your cone skills!</li>
    <li>Pass and touch the ball against a wall with each foot. </li>
    <li>Write down your soccer goals.</li>
  </ul>
